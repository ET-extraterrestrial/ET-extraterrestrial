# 👽 ET here.

Still figuring out Wi-Fi on my spaceship, but I’ve mastered Earth tech — sort of.  
I debug with my glowing finger and sometimes leave comments in a language no one understands (literally).  
Mostly, I just want to go home, but I guess I’ll stick around for the open-source community. 🌌✨  

## 🛠️ Skills:  
- 🚀 **Intergalactic travel**  
- 🛸 **Alien tech**  
- ☎️ **Can call home without a phone**

## 🎯 Goals:  
- **Learn Git** (still confused about branching... do I need a tree? 🌳)  
- **Find Reese's Pieces** hidden in the codebase 🍬

**Let’s make code that’s out of this world!** 🌠
